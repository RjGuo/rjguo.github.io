They become significant for carrier dynamics at low temperature,where phonons are frozen out.</p><p>However, first-principle calculations of electron-defect interactions are still in their infancy. Those calculations need large supercells to obtain the electron wave function and defect perturbation potentials, which may lead huge computational cost. Here, I’d like to introduce a more efficient scheme to compute the electron-defect scattering matrix elements. This approach is firstly proposed by Bernardi’s group at Caltech, and it dose not require the wave functions of large supercells, which dramatically accelerates the calculations.</p><h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The electron-defect scattering matrix elements $M_{n^{\prime} k^{\prime} , nk}$ encode the probability amplitude from the unperturbed state $|nk\rangle$ to $|n^\prime k^\prime \rangle$ due to the perturbation potential $\Delta V_{e-d}$ from a defect:<br>$$<br>M_{n^{\prime} k^{\prime} , nk} = \langle n^\prime k^\prime | \Delta V_{e-d} | nk\rangle<br>$$</p>]]></content>

Therefore, two-dimensional materials with hexagonal lattice should be the most competitive candidates to be applied in valleytronic devices.<br><img src="/img/valley1.png" width="75%" height="75%"></p><h2 id="Valley-polarization"><a href="#Valley-polarization" class="headerlink" title="Valley polarization"></a>Valley polarization</h2><p>In order to distinguish non-equivalent valleys, the major challenage in two-dimensional valley materials is  to break the degeneracy between the valleys, thus forming the valley polarization, which opens a window for capturing the valley degree of freedom and is indispensable for valleytronic applications.</p><h2 id="Valley-hall-effect-and-Berry-curvature"><a href="#Valley-hall-effect-and-Berry-curvature" class="headerlink" title="Valley hall effect and Berry curvature"></a>Valley hall effect and Berry curvature</h2><h2 id="Perspective-from-electron-mobility"><a href="#Perspective-from-electron-mobility" class="headerlink" title="Perspective (from electron mobility)"></a>Perspective (from electron mobility)</h2>]]></content>

They become significant for carrier dynamics at low temperature,where phonons are frozen out.</p><p>However, first-principle calculations of electron-defect interactions are still in their infancy. Those calculations need large supercells to obtain the electron wave function and defect perturbation potentials, which may lead huge computational cost. Here, I’d like to introduce a more efficient scheme to compute the electron-defect scattering matrix elements. This approach is firstly proposed by Bernardi’s group at Caltech, and it dose not require the wave functions of large supercells, which dramatically accelerates the calculations.</p><h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The electron-defect scattering matrix elements <script type="math/tex">M_{n^{\prime} k^{\prime} , nk}</script> encode the probability amplitude from the unperturbed state <script type="math/tex">|nk\rangle</script> to <script type="math/tex">|n^\prime k^\prime \rangle</script> due to the perturbation potential <script type="math/tex">\Delta V_{e-d}</script> from a defect:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">M_{n^{\prime} k^{\prime} , nk} = \langle n^\prime k^\prime | \Delta V_{e-d} | nk\rangle</script>]]></content>
